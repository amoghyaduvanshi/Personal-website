            <h1>Rich Dad and Poor Dad</h1>
            <p class="intro-text"> This was actually my first ever financial book which I read. The author of the personal finance book "Rich Dad Poor Dad" is Robert Kiyosaki. The story is based on Kiyosaki's own experiences growing up with two father figures: his biological father, a highly educated government official (referred to in the book as the "Poor Dad"), and the self-made billionaire father of his best friend (referred to in the book as the "Rich Dad").
            </p>
            <p>  The book contrasts the philosophies and spending habits of these two fathers and provides insight into how each method impacts their capacity to generate income. The secret to financial success, in Kiyosaki's opinion, is not one's level of education or job title, but rather one's outlook on and approach to money. </p>
            <p> The book offers a variety of concepts, such as the significance of developing passive income sources, establishing investments that generate cash flow, and being financially literate. As opposed to playing it safe and avoiding risk completely, Kiyosaki emphasizes the need for taking chances and learning from failure.</p>
            <p>In general, "Rich Dad Poor Dad" exhorts readers to develop a mindset centered on accumulating wealth and financial freedom rather than merely working for a wage and living paycheck to paycheck.</p>

        <h1>The subtle art of not giving a f</h1>
        <p>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck" is a self-help book written by Mark Manson. The book challenges the traditional self-help and positive thinking approaches and encourages readers to embrace their flaws, prioritize what truly matters to them, and let go of things that don't.        </p>
        <p>The central idea of the book is that by accepting that life is inherently difficult and that we can't control everything, we can focus our time and energy on what truly matters to us and find fulfillment in the process. Manson argues that trying to avoid pain and discomfort is counterproductive and that embracing these negative experiences can lead to personal growth and a more fulfilling life.        </p>
        <p>The book also emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility for our own lives, being honest with ourselves about our limitations and weaknesses, and letting go of the need for constant validation and approval from others.        </p>
        <p>Overall, "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck" provides a refreshing and thought-provoking perspective on self-improvement and personal growth, encouraging readers to focus on what truly matters and let go of the rest.        </p>

                <li>"Not giving a f*ck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different."                </li>
                <li>"Pain is an inextricable thread in the fabric of life, and to tear it out is not only impossible, but destructive: attempting to tear it out unravels everything else with it."                </li>
